## Sorting Algorithms and Data Structures II Projects

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms and Data Structures II Projects repository! This repository contains implementations of sorting algorithms and data structures in C and Python, along with projects developed during my Data Structures II class.

### Sorting Algorithms

Explore different sorting algorithms implemented in C and Python:

- **Bubble Sort:** Simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Counting Sort:** Counting the numbers that are greater than a fixed number and then sort based on the counts obtained.
- **Selection Sort:** In-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sorted part at the left end and the unsorted part at the right end.
- **Insertion Sort:** Efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort:** Divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively breaks down a list into smaller sublists until each sublist consists of a single element and then merges those sublists in a manner that results in a sorted list.
- **Quick Sort:** Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that partitions the array into smaller sub-arrays based on a pivot element and recursively sorts each sub-array.
- **Heap Sort:** Comparison-based sorting algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements.


### Data Structures II Projects

In addition to sorting algorithms, this repository showcases projects developed during my Data Structures II class. You can check all the description in each folder that contains a PDF file.
